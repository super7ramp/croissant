## Croissant

This is a crossword solver backed by various SAT solvers.

This is *very* slow.

This is unusable.

*This is a toy project.*

### Goals

- âœ… Have fun!
- âœ… Explore SAT solvers available in Rust:
    - âœ… [Splr](https://crates.io/crates/Splr)
    - âœ… [LogicNG](https://crates.io/crates/Logicng)
    - âœ… [CaDiCaL](https://crates.io/crates/Cadical)
- ðŸš§ Implement a CLI using [clap](https://crates.io/crates/clap).
- ðŸš§ Understand Cargo feature configuration: Put each bundled solver behind a feature flag.
- ðŸš§ Scratch dynamic loading in Rust: Allow to use solvers loaded from shared libraries put in some folder.
- ðŸš§ Document and publish a crate.
