## Croissant

This is a crossword solver backed by various SAT solvers.

This is *slow*.

This is unusable.

*This is a toy project.*

### Play

First, install [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) – you'll need the nightly toolchain.

Then try this out:

```
cargo run "\
....
..#.
A..."
```

It should return:

```
CHIZ
HE#O
ASIA
```

Good job! You just created a crossword. Now you can read the help page:

```
🥐 Welcome to Croissant, a crossword solver that smells good

Usage: croissant-cli [OPTIONS] <GRID>

Arguments:
  <GRID>
          The grid as a string; Each new line is a new row, '.' is a blank, '#' is a block

          The path to the word list; File must contain one word per line and nothing else

  -s, --solver <SOLVER>

          [default: logicng]

          Possible values:
          - cadical: The slow; Its name sounds good though, doesn't it?
          - logicng: The less slow and thus the default; Congrats!
          - splr:    The slowest and buggiest, but that's why we love it ❤️

  -c, --count <COUNT>
          The desired number of solutions
          
          [default: 1]

          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
```

Enjoy!
